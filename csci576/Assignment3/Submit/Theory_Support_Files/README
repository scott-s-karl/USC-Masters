Assignment 3 Submission
------------------------

Files Present:
-----------------
Problem_1: (Directory)
1. DCT_Coding.py -> This is the file that was used to help support problem 1 of the homework:
   1. Shows DCT for the given source data
   2. Shows Quantization table
   3. Shows Zig Zag notation
   4. Shows the Intemidary AC notation

Problem_2: (Directory)
1. DWT_Compression_main.java -> The main file to run for Problem 2
2. READ_RGB.java -> Supporting file that reads the .rgb files into a usable array
3. Process_Image.java -> Supporting file that processes the image data based on the low pass level
4. Convert_Image.java -> Supporting file that writes the image array data into a buffered image
5. DisplayImage.java -> Supporting file that displays the image or images based on the low pass level input

Theory_Support_Files: (Directory)
1. Assignment3.pdf -> Writeup file that contains the answers to Problem 1 that weren't programming related
2. README -> This file that explains the submitted information

Prerequistes:
------------------
1. Java installed on your computer -> For Problem 2
2. Specific version I was using:
   Command -> java --version
   Result:
	Java 17.0.4.1 2022-08-18 LTS
	Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 17.0.4.1+1-LTS-2)
	Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 17.0.4.1+1-LTS-2, mixed mode, sharing)
3. Python Installed on your computer -> For Problem 1
4. Specific version I was using:
   Command -> python3 --version
   Result:
	Python 3.9.7

Problem 1 - How to run the code:
--------------------------------
1. Navigate to the directory for Problem 1
   a. Open Terminal to root of submitted project.
   b. Type in cd Problem_1
2. Run the Code
   a. python3 DCT_Coding.py
   **Note: Depending on your python version the command to run this script could be just python instead of python3

Problem 2 - How to run the code:
--------------------------------
1. Navigate to the directory for Problem 2
   a. Open Terminal to root of submitted project.
   b. Type in cd Problem_2
2. Compile the code
   a. Command -> javac *.java
3. Run the code:
   Command -> java DWT_Compression_main <image path> <low pass level>
   Instructions: To run the code you use the above command with the input parameters as shown in the
   assignment writup. It only accepts the format any more or any less arguments will not work.
4. Low Pass Level Settings:
   1. 0 - 9:
      1. This will encode to the indicated level
      2. Zero out the high pass coeficients
      3. Decode to get the resulting image
   2. -1:
      1. This will encode all the way to 0 level
      2. This will then decode to each level in turn up to 9
      3. The remaining high pass coeficients will then be zeroed out
      4. Then the image will be finished decoding with zeros for the high pass coeficients
      5. The images will be display in separate frames however they will appear stacked on one another.
      6. Also if you close one of the frames all will close so be careful
5. Image Path:
   1. Need to be a valid .rgb file image
