EE450 Project - Notes

General Info:
--------------
1. Creating a simplified version of a blockchain system that will help to understand how cryptocurrency transactions work.

2. We will have 3 nodes on the blockchain where each stores a group of transactions.
   a. These are representing the backend servers

3. We will have a main server that is in charge of all the calulations and updating the wallets for each user.

4. Transactions:
   a. Transaction Number
   b. Sender
   c. Receiver
   d. Amount being transferred

5. Clients A and B communicate with a main server to pull information from the backend servers A,B, and C.
   a. Client to Main -- TCP
   b. Main to Servers -- UDP

6. Source Files:
   a. serverM.c
   b. serverA.c, serverB.c, serverC.c
   c. clientA.c
   d. clientB.c
